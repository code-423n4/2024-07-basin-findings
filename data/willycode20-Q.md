# Low Risk Findings.

## L-01 Consider changing the modifier name from `notDelegatedOrIsMinimalProxy` to `delegatedOrIsMinimalProxy`
### Summary 
The modifier `notDelegatedOrIsMinimalProxy` check first if the call is made through a delegate call before implementing its intended logic. Therefore, the function should be changed to `delegatedOrIsMinimalProxy` to align with the modifier intended check, `if (address(this) != __self`, allowing for only delegate call

    
### Recommended Mitigation Step
Consider making the following adjustment
```diff
  --    modifier notDelegatedOrIsMinimalProxy() {
  ++    modifier delegatedOrIsMinimalProxy() {
        if (address(this) != ___self) {
            address aquifer = aquifer();
            address wellImplmentation = 
            IAquifer(aquifer).wellImplementation(address(this));
            require(wellImplmentation == ___self, "Function must be called by a 
        Well bored by an aquifer");
        } else {
  --        revert("UUPSUpgradeable: must not be called through delegatecall");
  ++        revert
        }
        _;
    }

```
## L-02 Consider using the modified modifier in the internal function `_authorizeUpgrade` for better simplicity 
### Summary
Since the internal function `_authorizeUpgrade` perform initial similar check to that specified in the modifier, the modifier can therefore be integrated into the internal function to allow for unambiguous code usage.

comparing the modifier and function using the link below

And, [https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-basin/blob/7d5aacbb144d0ba0bc358dfde6e0cc913d25310e/src/WellUpgradeable.sol#L65-L72] for the internal function.
it can be observed that they both perform similar checks

    
### Recommended Mitigation Step
Integrate the modifier into the internal function `_authorizeUpgrade`

## L-03 Change the visibility of the function `proxiableUUID` from external to public
### Summary
Specifying a function as external prevent it from being called by functions in the same contract, prior to my medium finding in which the `_authorizeUpgrade` calls the function `proxiableUUID` from the inherited contract `UUPSUpgradeable`, it can be observed there is a discrepancy between their require statement, observe the function below
```solidity

       function _authorizeUpgrade(address newImplmentation) internal view 
           override {
        // verify the function is called through a delegatecall.
       @> require(address(this) != ___self, "Function must be called through 
           delegatecall");

        // verify the function is called through an active proxy bored by an 
           aquifer.
           address aquifer = aquifer();
           address activeProxy = 
           IAquifer(aquifer).wellImplementation(_getImplementation());
        require(activeProxy == ___self, "Function must be called through active 
           proxy bored by an aquifer");

        // verify the new implmentation is a well bored by an aquifier.
        require(
           IAquifer(aquifer).wellImplementation(newImplmentation) != address(0),
           "New implementation must be a well implmentation"
        );   

        // verify the new implmentation is a valid ERC-1967 implmentation.
        require(
            UUPSUpgradeable(newImplmentation).proxiableUUID() == 
            _IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT,
            "New implementation must be a valid ERC-1967 implmentation"
        );
    }

```

And

```solidity

        modifier notDelegated() {
    @>    require(address(this) == __self, "UUPSUpgradeable: must not be called 
           through delegatecall");
        _;
    }

    /**
     * @dev Implementation of the ERC1822 {proxiableUUID} function. This returns 
     the storage slot used by the
     * implementation. It is used to validate the implementation's compatibility 
     when performing an upgrade.
     *
     * IMPORTANT: A proxy pointing at a proxiable contract should not be 
     considered proxiable itself, because this risks
     * bricking a proxy that upgrades to it, by delegating to itself until out 
     of gas. Thus it is critical that this
     * function revert if invoked through a proxy. This is guaranteed by the 
     `notDelegated` modifier.
     */
    function proxiableUUID() external view virtual override notDelegated returns 
    (bytes32) {
        return _IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT;
    }

```

It can be observed that the require statement of the internal function `_authorizeUpgrade` and that of the modifier used in the function `proxiableUUID` contradict each other.

### Recommended Mitigation Step
This can be corrected or avoided by just calling directly into the `proxiableUUID` specified in the contract. Hence, changing this function visibility from external to public solves this issue.
## L-04 Adding access control to some function in the `WellUpgradeable` contract

### Summary
Consider adding access control or well defined modifiers to prevent unauthorized personnel from calling certain functions in the `WellUpgradeable` contract. Example of such function include
-`upgradeTo`
-`upgradeToAndCall`

### Recommended Mitigation Step
Add access control or well defined modifier to these functions
