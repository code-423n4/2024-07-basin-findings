## Low Issues


### [L-01] Misleading modifier name in `WellUpgradeable` contract

The `notDelegatedOrIsMinimalProxy` modifier in the `WellUpgradeable` contract has a misleading name. The current logic ensures that the function is called through a minimal proxy and not through a delegate call. However, the name suggests that the function should allow execution if it is not a delegate call or if it is called through a minimal proxy, which can be confusing for developers and auditors.

The protocol team mentioned in the private thread that:
> the modifier is working as intended, but the name of the function may not be indicative of what it should do.

#### Relevant Code:
[WellUpgradeable.sol#L19-L31](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-basin/blob/7d5aacbb144d0ba0bc358dfde6e0cc913d25310e/src/WellUpgradeable.sol#L19-L31)
```solidity
modifier notDelegatedOrIsMinimalProxy() {
    if (address(this) != ___self) {
        address aquifer = aquifer();
        address wellImplementation = IAquifer(aquifer).wellImplementation(address(this));
        require(wellImplementation == ___self, "Function must be called by a Well bored by an aquifer");
    } else {
        revert("UUPSUpgradeable: must not be called through delegatecall");
    }
    _;
}
```

### Impact:
The misleading name can lead to confusion and misinterpretation of the contract's logic, potentially causing developers to misuse the modifier or misunderstand its purpose.

### Recommendation:
Rename the modifier to something more indicative of its purpose, such as `onlyValidProxyCall`, to improve code readability and maintainability.

#### Suggested Fix:
```solidity
modifier onlyValidProxyCall() {
    if (address(this) != ___self) {
        address aquifer = aquifer();
        address wellImplementation = IAquifer(aquifer).wellImplementation(address(this));
        require(wellImplementation == ___self, "Function must be called by a Well bored by an aquifer");
    } else {
        revert("UUPSUpgradeable: must not be called through delegatecall");
    }
    _;
}
```




### [L-02] Unnecessary restriction in `WellUpgradeable::proxiableUUID()` function

The `proxiableUUID()` function uses the `notDelegatedOrIsMinimalProxy` modifier, which is unnecessary and incorrect. The purpose of `proxiableUUID()` is to return the storage slot used by the implementation, as per the ERC-1822 standard. This function should be callable to verify the implementation's compatibility without any restrictions.

The `notDelegatedOrIsMinimalProxy` modifier checks if the call is a delegate call and reverts if it is not. This logic is not relevant to the `proxiableUUID()` function and introduces unnecessary restrictions.

#### Relevant code:
[WellUpgradeable.sol#L118-L120](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-07-basin/blob/7d5aacbb144d0ba0bc358dfde6e0cc913d25310e/src/WellUpgradeable.sol#L118-L120)
```solidity
function proxiableUUID() external view override notDelegatedOrIsMinimalProxy returns (bytes32) {
    return _IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT;
}
```

### Recommendation:
Remove the `notDelegatedOrIsMinimalProxy` modifier from the `proxiableUUID()` function to ensure it can be called without unnecessary restrictions.

Updated code:
```solidity
function proxiableUUID() external view override returns (bytes32) {
    return _IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT;
}
```




### [L-03] Repetitive nested if-else statements in price ratio functions reduce maintainability in `Stable2LUT1.sol`

The `getRatiosFromPriceLiquidity()` and `getRatiosFromPriceSwap()` functions contain highly repetitive nested if-else statements for handling different price ranges. This structure makes the code difficult to read, maintain, and scale as the number of price ranges increases.

### Recommendation: 
Refactor the price range logic using a more maintainable data structure, such as an array of price range objects. Implement a loop to iterate through the price ranges and return the corresponding `PriceData`. For example:

```solidity
struct PriceRange {
    uint256 lowerBound;
    uint256 upperBound;
    PriceData data;
}

PriceRange[] private priceRanges;

function getRatiosFromPriceLiquidity(uint256 price) external view returns (PriceData memory) {
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < priceRanges.length; i++) {
        if (price >= priceRanges[i].lowerBound && price < priceRanges[i].upperBound) {
            return priceRanges[i].data;
        }
    }
    revert("LUT: Invalid price");
}
```

This approach improves code readability, maintainability, and scalability while preserving the original functionality.



## Non-Critical Issues



### [NC-01] Redundant checks in nested if-else structure leading to inefficiency

The `getRatiosFromPriceLiquidity()` and `getRatiosFromPriceSwap()` functions contain deeply nested if-else statements with redundant checks. For example, if `price < 0.27702e6` is true, then `price < 0.30624e6` is also true, making the second check redundant within that branch. This redundancy can lead to higher gas costs and reduced readability.

Relevant code:
```solidity
function getRatiosFromPriceLiquidity(uint256 price) external pure returns (PriceData memory) {
    if (price < 1.006758e6) {
        if (price < 0.885627e6) {
            if (price < 0.59332e6) {
                if (price < 0.404944e6) {
                    if (price < 0.30624e6) {
                        if (price < 0.27702e6) {
                            if (price < 0.001083e6) {
                                revert("LUT: Invalid price");
                            } else {
                                return PriceData(0.27702e6, 0, 9.646293093274934449e18, 0.001083e6, 0, 2000e18, 1e18);
                            }
                        } else {
                            return PriceData(0.30624e6, 0, 8.612761690424049377e18, 0.27702e6, 0, 9.646293093274934449e18, 1e18);
                        }
                    } else {
                        // ... more nested if-else statements ...
                    }
                } else {
                    // ... more nested if-else statements ...
                }
            } else {
                // ... more nested if-else statements ...
            }
        } else {
            // ... more nested if-else statements ...
        }
    } else {
        // ... more nested if-else statements ...
    }
}
```

### Recommendation:
Refactor the logic to eliminate redundant checks, improving readability, maintainability, and gas efficiency. For example, use a single level of if-else statements to ensure each condition is checked only once
