## Title:
 1. Lack of Explicit Access Control on Upgrade Functions

## Description:
The `upgradeTo` and `upgradeToAndCall` functions are public, meaning it can be called by anyone. 

The `_authorizeUpgrade` function implements strong checks that significantly mitigate the risk of unauthorized upgrades. 

However, adding an explicit access control (like onlyOwner) to these functions would provide an additional layer of security.

## Recommendation:
Add an explicit access control (like onlyOwner) to the upgrade functions

## Title: 
2. Inefficient duplicate token check in `WellUpgradeable::init` function

## Description:
The `init` function includes a nested loop to check for duplicate tokens, which can be optimized:

```
for (uint256 i; i < tokensLength - 1; ++i) {
    for (uint256 j = i + 1; j < tokensLength; ++j) {
        if (_tokens[i] == _tokens[j]) {
            revert DuplicateTokens(_tokens[i]);
        }
    }
}
```

While functionally correct, this nested loop is not the most efficient or readable approach.

## Recommendation:
Consider using a mapping to track tokens and identify duplicates in a single loop, which would enhance both readability and efficiency:

```
mapping(address => bool) tokenMap;
for (uint256 i; i < tokensLength; ++i) {
    if (tokenMap[_tokens[i]]) {
        revert DuplicateTokens(_tokens[i]);
    }
    tokenMap[_tokens[i]] = true;
}
```
